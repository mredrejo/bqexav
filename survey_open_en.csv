"15",2017,"We have learned in a completely different way, thinking for ourselves and knowing the why and wherefore of the different steps.","Mainly the lack of organization in the first days, nobody knew what to do because each teacher said something different, also the lack of compliance with the schedule has affected too much, these last weeks are very important for students to start studying for final exams (taking into account that at Christmas there are only two weeks), and being in practice morning and afternoon does not contribute to it;","The overall balance has been positive because we have learned a lot, but this new method of teaching needs to be polished so that the students are not saturated and there are not so many dead hours.",NA,NA,NA
"16",2017,"It has allowed us to develop our own ideas and learn to work as a team. It has also allowed us to be aware and responsible for every step we took in the lab. In general, it has allowed us to acquire more knowledge and experience than a traditional internship.","Too many hours in the lab compared to those specified in the teaching guide (and unequal between groups) and that have altered our work schedule at home. There should have been more coordination between teachers, especially when it came to transmitting to us what we should include in the protocols and lab reports.","I believe that this practice model should be continued but that there are many things to improve.",NA,NA,NA

"19",2017,"They serve to bring you closer to the life of the laboratory","More individual meetings with each group are needed.","The first day of work in the laboratory should be dedicated to learn how to work with the chosen model organism and the following days the protocols should be started. It would also be good to make a common protocol with the whole group to have an idea of how they are done.",NA,NA,NA
"20",2017,"It has been the most useful internship so far in our degree. I think that the strategy followed for these practices has been very good, it has allowed us to understand why and for what we do things well, as well as to interpret all kinds of results. The help of the teachers has been excellent (Juan in my case), guiding us but allowing us to reach the conclusions ourselves;","Lack of agarose gel cuvettes and better organization of time","",NA,NA,NA
"21",2017,"A different vision of the practices that we had been doing during these 3 years of career.","-The lack of organization in terms of the distribution of work, the limited availability of instruments in the laboratory, which conditioned and limited the progress of the designed experiments, and the short time given for the delivery of protocols, especially during the first week;","-the trainees must agree on the time to solve the doubts because many of them told you the opposite to another previously.&nbsp;-organize beforehand the experiments and see if it is really possible to carry them out in the laboratory conditions, depending on the number of students, the space available and the time required for each experiment.",NA,NA,NA
"22",2017,"Learning about bioinformatics, more independence in the lab, decision making skills, organizational skills;","The material is insufficient, especially the laminar flow cabinets, the predoc support students were lost, at the beginning there was not much coordination among the professors.","The most important thing for me is that there is coordination from the first moment of the teachers. The students arrive at the laboratory quite lost, and at the beginning they should guide the groups more and act in a more coordinated way.",NA,NA,NA
"23",2017,"It is the first time in the whole career that a practical subject is really practical. I think it makes the most sense to hand in the protocols as a group.

"24",2017,"-At some point we had to start from scratch and set up the experiments ourselves in order to obtain a specific objective; the teachers of the transcription group have put a lot of emphasis on me learning and understanding why to use one technique or another, what for, how to analyze the results.","-The final exam will not provide an acquisition of knowledge similar to that obtained in the laboratory and different discussion sessions. It may even be detrimental, but it remains to be seen - The practical part should have more weight in the final grade - It is not necessary to evaluate everything and so from the beginning. If you want us to face certain circumstances on our own, there must be room for learning.","",NA,NA,NA
"25",2017,"Design the experiments ourselves and know which controls to use in each experiment.","The feedback was quite poor, and we were not aware of how to do the protocol until a week before handing it in, making us change the whole planning, and often there was not enough staff (teachers) to answer questions and that delayed the progress of the experiment. Many times there was not enough staff (teachers) to be able to answer the questions and that delayed a lot the progress of the experiment.The grouping by teams in a random way greatly harms if one of the members does all the work and the other almost does not contribute; since the note is distributed.&nbsp;","Better organization. Be more organized and know well what will be done in each moment.There is more feedback from teachers.Let choose the coworkers, not for ""favoritism"" but because we know who really works in the laboratory.&nbsp;",NA,NA,NA
"26",2017,"We have learned more than in previous internships that were limited to following a protocol. With this internship model, you become more involved in your work and learn how to follow protocols and overcome problems that arise.","Some more time to carry out the experiments without haste and to obtain more conclusive results. As for the materials, there was only one bell per laboratory (more than 5 groups) and because of this, we had problems of scheduling and coordination&nbsp;","",NA,NA,NA
"27",2017,"An innovative approach in the practices, in my opinion much more useful for our future work, because we experience first hand how a laboratory and a research team works, allowing us to integrate data from different groups and encouraging us to think for ourselves how to solve problems.","Being the first year with this approach, there was initially a bit of chaos in the organization, and we received several times different information, although it was later clarified.","For the following year it would be good to have a better premeditated organization that would allow students to perform more experiments and cover more different approaches that allow for more learning.",NA,NA,NA
"28",2017,"The ability to think for ourselves the purpose of the experiments, that although it has been necessary to do them a first time in the practices of 1 and 2 because it was our first contact with many techniques, just to do them again without thinking in 3 would be ridiculous so I think the change of practices was necessary.another positive aspect has been the freedom to do things without being so over us as if we were children, there have been some big failures but I think that also learns and we have to stumble to learn.","We know that in a laboratory you know when you enter but not when you leave, however I think that the hours indicated in the timetable and the credits assigned to the subject are not real, it would be equivalent to at least 6 hours a day minimum and not 4 The disorganization that was noticeable in the teachers at the beginning, although then it has improved and I understand that it is the first time that this type of practice is done, at the beginning we were as lost students as teachers on where to go.","I think it was a necessary change and being in 3 is something that should have been done earlier.",NA,NA,NA
"29",2017,"This different approach is a good idea because it allows students to become more involved in the experiment, to be interested in it and to look for additional information. In addition, the fact that each group performs different experiments allows the sharing of information to be more enriching and to study several points of view of the same problem, something that cannot be done by all doing the same experiment;","Being the first course in which this approach is carried out, we noticed a slight lack of control when organizing the activities, sometimes the teachers did not agree and we received different information. We would also have liked to be able to carry out the whole second experiment and to have more freedom in choosing when to do each experiment because with the first one we had to stick to the schedules provided by the teachers and the days indicated by them;","",NA,NA,NA
"30",2017,"-Learning to hypothesize and conduct experiments based on that hypothesis in an efficient and critical way, not simply following a protocol.","- The mess there was at the beginning around the elaboration of the protocol.","The internships have been very good and the involvement of the teachers is appreciated. Of course much better than the traditional internships in all aspects. The only thing missing would be to organize them a little more (dates of deliveries, lab meetings, that teachers agree on what we have to deliver or have prepared for the following days ...), but surely next year this aspect will improve a lot, as I think it is due to the lack of experience in this new model of practices. In general, thank you for having applied this internship model and not the traditional one, I hope it will continue like this in the next years;",NA,NA,NA
"31",2017,"Critical thinking, reasoning and teamwork have been strongly encouraged. We have come very close to a real work situation in the laboratory and as the practices developed we have seen ourselves looser and with the ability to make autonomous decisions.","Little emphasis has been placed on the protocols and why each step was done, it has been necessary to explain more concepts and theory in this senseWe understand that it is the first year that this has been done, but it has lacked a little more organization and planning to optimize the working hours in the laboratory.","",NA,NA,NA
"32",2017,"Learning to think for ourselves in a laboratory.learning to face a problem, to pose a hypothesis, to consider the possible results and the possible errors that have prevented its correct realization.teamwork that provided us with continuous feedback both within our group and with the other groups.","Number of hours in the practice laboratory.","I think it is a great idea to carry out this subject in this way, until now it was always to follow an established protocol and not to think by ourselves a hypothesis and possible experiments, it seems to me that this is the way in which we have to approach the experimental ones because we learn to manage by ourselves in a laboratory.",NA,NA,NA
"33",2017,"It is innovative and breaks with the schemes of traditional practices, bringing us closer to the laboratory work in a more realistic way in order to carry out the end-of-degree work, and also allowing us to achieve greater independence in the realization of our work;","Lack of organization among professors, frequent contradictory information in relation to the experiments, lack of anticipation in the correction of protocols that were already being carried out before their own correction, scarce time for the completion of the protocol, excess of hours needed to perform many of the experiments that meant exceeding by far the number of hours required to carry them out, problems with the reservation of the booths (insufficient number for the demand of groups that forced them to come even before the start time of the practices).&nbsp;","There is an imbalance in terms of the workload that falls on each teacher. They should all be able to solve the doubts that arise in the practices, but the reality is that this is not the case. You should also be able to choose the members of your internship group;",NA,NA,NA
"34",2017,"It allows you to gain autonomy. It implies that you have to be very clear about what you are going to do to organize the day and what you need. It involves acquiring and developing self-criticism skills, as well as having to deduce the possible failures of the experiments.in addition, we managed to collect a lot of information, which results in a relatively satisfactory practice.I especially HIGHLIGHT the role of Rojo, who has been a fundamental support in the whole process. Excellent in explaining and in the treatment, having absolutely no complaints, but quite the opposite.","In the case of Biochemistry, I would criticize the organization, since the idea was to do two experiments that were reduced to one due to the lack of culture booths. This resulted in several groups spending several days doing very few things and also between 3, so that results in less work than other groups, causing some disappointment.","",NA,NA,NA
"35",2017,"I really liked the approach to the subject, allowing the development and independence of the students;","In general, disorganization and lack of coordination in terms of evaluation of protocols, tasks to be performed. There have been days when we have not been doing anything;","Victor Calvo should not be in the BEXAI course because he was often not in the lab, he did not know what to answer and gave ambiguous answers.",NA,NA,NA
"36",2017,"It is a new way to carry out the practices that entails much more learning, and personally I think it is much more interesting. It forces us to think more, work more and therefore to learn how to perform better in a laboratory.","Sometimes the organization was not good, and it was not clear to us what was being evaluated. Also, quite a few things in the general protocols were not correct;","The help of the scholarship holders who have been with us has been enormous. So I see that this format of help, apart from the teachers, should be maintained;",NA,NA,NA
"37",2017,"Open question model is great for learning how to formulate hyptheses, design experiments to support them, record and analyze data and draw conclusions. Overall, this approach has been fairly satisfactory.","Teachers did not reach a consensus regarding assessment of lab activities.Planning of activities is required - limitations of materials should be avoided by scheduling every group's work collectively to prevent crowding and total lack of small lab material.","Please, STATE CLEARLY what students are expected to record in their lab reports for assessment. This has been a big source of confusion.Assessment of the final lab report should have a greater impact on the final grade, given that each group carried out their own projects, and assessment based on a multiple-option test, the same for all students, is not a fair assessment method. The final exam should either be specific for each lab group, based on their overall experimental approach, or have a smaller impact on the final grade.",NA,NA,NA
"38",2017,"I consider that the most positive thing has been learning to work in groups and to distribute tasks as well as the feedback between the different groups with different experiments that allow a very useful sharing. Of course, the most useful thing is to ask questions about a specific topic and to look for all possible approaches and to be able to adapt them to our capabilities and our availability;","Some problems of clarity in terms of things to deliver, which should be clearer or distributed differently. Also lack of material in many occasions.&nbsp;Perhaps organizational problems regarding the distribution of hours. &nbsp;","I think that the schedule should be distributed differently because there are days that the time in the lab has been excessive and a little tiring but because the process requires more time;",NA,NA,NA
"39",2017,"You learn to think the experiment for yourself and understand it and not just follow the protocol.","Being something we have never done before, I think that, especially at the beginning, we should be helped more in the lab, especially when preparing the first protocol. Especially asking us to hand in a protocol on the first day of practice without having done it and without anyone ever having explained to us how to do it seemed difficult and confusing instead of educational.&nbsp;Also sometimes the organization of the practices has led us to get lost because each teacher told us a different thing and we were not clear what was evaluated.","As a suggestion I would add a short class on how to make a protocol before asking for one from us, because when following the moodle indications and then correcting it there were many things that were wrong. on the other hand I think that the help of the interns is essential for these practices since I consider that without their help I would not have understood many things since the teachers are busier and can not give us so much attention and so individual.",NA,NA,NA
"40",2017,"-Learning to work in a team-Having the initiative to design protocols and critical thinking of the written documents before carrying them out-Use of bioinformatics tools-Interpretation of results.","-The organization of the days, since there were down times.","Thank you very much for carrying out this new initiative of the Advanced Experimental Biochemistry I course. It motivates the students to develop everything they have learned in the theoretical classes by themselves, as well as to value the work of weeks in the laboratory. Undoubtedly, this new proposal should be continued in subsequent years.",NA,NA,NA

Seeing the potential of the techniques, but at the same time the difficulty of getting it right.4.","Only one teacher for so many.two people in a single group being one of them from Erasmus that I do not know if he did not understand things or not and did not participate in developing protocols. At least, put Erasmus people in a group of 3 always.Much lack of material for all, lack of cuvette separators having own cuvettes.Too much work without more, we organized ourselves, I did not like forcing to do things just for overconfidence, better to delve into the experiments and repeat.Make controls and carry biological duplicates.Please, let choose our partners, we will not choose our partners but we really know with whom you can work.","More practice time.",NA,NA,NA
"42",2017,"I strongly prefer the open-ended question approach. Its fundamental benefit is that it involves the students much more, motivates them more and therefore increases the knowledge obtained. By feeling the experiment as personal, one is more involved. I think it also emphasizes the ability to analyze what controls are necessary, although in my group there was not enough emphasis on that.&nbsp;It is very good that we were given such a good list of general protocols.&nbsp;","In my group, there was not much emphasis on the necessary controls and I believe that this is one of the fundamental points that the open-ended question model helps to emphasize.&nbsp;On the day of sharing in the laboratory itself, some more organization is needed to avoid redundant information.Another point is that in the biochemistry group, although we had designed the experiments, in the end it was the teachers who distributed them. Therefore, in reality, the experiment was not the one we had designed or similar, but totally devised by the professors. The only thing that differentiated it from the closed-question format was that we had to adapt the protocols. Therefore, I propose that even if our experiments are not ideal, just direct us to what is possible, instead of directly giving us the design themselves;","",NA,NA,NA
"43",2017,"- It allows to have initiative to approach questions in one way or another- It allows to think about the conclusions and better approaches of the experiments, which does not happen with the programmed practices because they already start from predetermined experiments that must come out correctly.","- More information on what to deliver each day and what will be evaluable in each case- More feedback during the practices and not once the experiments are already advanced.","",NA,NA,NA
"44",2017,"I have learned to hypothesize, to make protocols, to reason and think for myself what I think should be done. I have learned to work in a team and to share the tasks, to share the responsibility among all.&nbsp;I have learned to use bioinformatics tools, to interpret graphs and to elaborate clear figures.&nbsp;In general what I value most is the opportunity that we have been given to be more autonomous and to reason.&nbsp;","The organization sometimes has not been adequate, since some days we had many experiments to do, while others not.&nbsp;As for the material, sometimes pipettes and tips were missing, and we had to share many things.&nbsp;Also the fact of working in trios makes that not all members participate equally, since some do some experiments and others do not.In the first sessions I think it is necessary to explain with a model how a hypothesis is formulated, and how a protocol is elaborated, since we had never done it before.&nbsp;I also think that there should be more involvement from the teachers in some occasions, and a consensus among them since sometimes they gave us contradictory solutions&nbsp;","",NA,NA,NA
"45",2017,"Encourages teamwork, initiative and reflection on why each experiment is performed.","Chaos in the method of qualification","It should be better explained what the notebook should contain, and feedback should be given almost daily to each group.",NA,NA,NA
"46",2017,"Radical change of approach to traditional practices that allows to get closer to the reality of a laboratory and requires a higher thinking capacity.Committed and involved teachers, as well as the ""assistants"".&nbsp;","No choice of working group, which can hinder the development of the internships, as it is the first year, there has been a lack of information during the first days, which has hindered individual work due to a lack of knowledge of the real objectives of the protocols. Lack of feedback from teachers at the beginning.","Give much clearer ideas about how the protocol should be written and what is to be assessed in the intro class.

"47",2017,"It invites you to put yourself in the role of a researcher who asks a question and has to find a way to find the answer.&nbsp;It awakens our ability to integrate all our knowledge and helps us to see to what extent we know the applications of what we have studied.","It is necessary to improve the organization, both in terms of time and materials, in order to improve the results of the experiments and the motivation of the students.","I would like to emphasize that for the good development of the experiments and the correct learning of the students, the exhaustive dedication of the teachers and laboratory personnel plays a fundamental role. This is especially important due to the individual character of the experiments. The teacher's encouragement for the students to share all their doubts before getting to work on any aspect is fundamental for this subject.Having said that, I think there were notable differences in the organization of the groups that should be improved to adapt to the established schedules.",NA,NA,NA
"48",2017,"This internship has been totally different from anything we have done so far, it has allowed us to realize many things that we did not know so far, such as the fact that you have to work much more than we thought because the design of the protocol takes a long time before working in the poyata. We have also learned what research is in a closer and more realistic way than doing the traditional practices that have been done all these previous years;","Some more coordination between the different teachers, since sometimes they were not clear about how the evaluation of the protocols was going to be carried out or when. We should be given feedback on our individual protocols before the group one is done or delivered, because mistakes made by all members of the group in the individual one will not be included in the group one because no one will be aware of them unless they are corrected;","",NA,NA,NA
"49",2017,"A good approach to be able to really build scientists for the future, the learning process is the right one.","Teachers who were not clear about the methodology and delayed the student (although not in our group), need for more hours (those that exist are unnecessary), greater freedom for the student to be able to carry out experiments individually (and not tied to a group), need for work sessions in groups of 3 to be able to carry out protocols and daily work much more in common.","A greater availability of time and techniques is necessary. Each student should have enough freedom to be able to carry out experiments on his own, which would greatly increase learning but would also increase the need for guidance (i.e., not doing the experiments in groups of 3 but in groups of 1). Finally, more time is needed because the student does not have the margin to be able to perform the experiments he/she wants and fine-tune them to obtain conclusions. In addition, the groups did not always work well and the distribution of the work after the laboratory was not equitable.

I think that explaining briefly and in a general way what are the most suitable techniques to see certain things would help us later in the design of our experiment. Something like making a more gradual transition from the system of practices used in previous courses in which we were given everything done and the system of this course, in which there is much more freedom and we are not yet fully prepared to think everything from scratch (in fact we had to consult many things to the teachers and there were recurring doubts).Another negative aspect is that, during the sharing, some teachers ask questions to students that often we do not have enough knowledge to answer and put us in a compromise. There is nothing wrong with asking us questions to make us think and reason, but it is not necessary to make uncomfortable all the students who are asked questions.finally, the most negative aspect of the course was the initial survey to mark the classmates with whom we do NOT want to work in the laboratory (even if there was an error and the results were public). It seems to me that it throws away the objective of learning to work in a group, which was so insisted on the first day, and that it is not realistic with what happens in the workplace, where you have to learn to work with people who are more or less like-minded. Either we are allowed to choose the people we DO want to work with or the groups are randomly selected, but the current system does not seem adequate to me.","Although there are still things to polish, the current system seems to me much better than the traditional script.

"105",2018,"- designing your own experiment that challenges the student and therefore motivates you to think and work towards your goals - teamwork with peers you have never worked with before, this helps you learn to work as a team with anyone, and to learn more diplomacy and to listen to people more. In addition, it strengthens the relationships between the different students making the whole class group atmosphere better. - It also helps to learn from mistakes, and to come up with solutions when an experiment doesn't work out. You really learn a lot more having to think about what could have gone wrong in an experiment that you have carried out and it didn't work out. - It is noticeable that there is a high concern on the part of the teachers and other staff for our learning. It is very important for the student to think and learn from their mistakes, which is very positive for their future. they learn to accept when something does not work out and to control frustration. a very positive aspect in the case of the transcription group is that at the beginning a lot of time is dedicated to think and design the experiment, in order to enter the laboratory with everything clear, and that the work in the laboratory is optimal. they learn to think and design a project well before carrying it out, which is very useful, since ""the head always has to go before the hands"".","- This is not the case in the transcription group, but in other groups I have been told that they did not have much experimental design time before entering the lab and the entry into the lab could be very overwhelming and chaotic. Whereas in my group, which did have this pre-experimental design time, they entered the lab ready to work and it went quite smoothly. - Obviously there are no means for this, but in the end, only having 2 teachers per group is not enough because they are always quite busy and sometimes doubts remain and we have to wait a long time to discuss them, or mistakes are made that would not have been made if there had been supervision. However, we know that it is not the teachers' fault, and that they have been working very hard to help us. - We could clarify better what is the protocol notebook and what is the final notebook and when to make deliveries (if you have to make weekly deliveries, or final delivery only etc) because it has been a bit chaotic in that aspect.

This, in my opinion, makes the students much more motivated, for example to look for literature at home, to ask relevant questions and to find the best way to perform the experiment. You design the whole experiment yourself, from the protocol to the relevant controls, which helps to understand the importance of performing all these steps correctly. In addition, you learn to reason what controls are missing, why some experiments are better or worse at answering a certain question, which you don't learn with a traditional internship where you are given the protocol and you follow it just like you follow a recipe.  ","In my opinion, more feedback time is needed after each session, to comment among all the members of the group what we have done, what has failed and what we could improve for the next time, as sometimes there is a bit of confusion and you don't really know what each member of the group is doing. I think this could help you learn more, especially about techniques or things that you haven't thought of or haven't done but that other colleagues have.On the other hand, I think there should be some kind of cross-sectional comparison between the different groups (flies, metabolism, etc), and give a small percentage of evaluation based on the comparison of different points. For example, transcript has done statistics, and has not given for good results that are not statistically significant, however, most other groups have not taken statistics into account. Or, perhaps, there are groups that have very rigorously detailed everything they have done each day and groups that have not, or groups that have only one poorly developed notebook versus groups that have up to 4 well-developed notebooks. In my opinion this should be taken into account to ""standardize"" a bit the evaluations between the different groups and try to make the transversal competences (statistics, notebook, etc) of all the groups as homogeneous as possible. Because otherwise, depending on the teacher you get, in my case, Luis, you learn a lot of statistics, but if you get another teacher you may not learn anything about statistics but you learn how to perform the most appropriate controls (in the case of Jose in the yeast group), and I think we should try that everyone acquires these ""basic"" and essential skills. Perhaps this evaluation could be done by teachers from different groups of students (one from each group) and then make the average between the grades assigned by all teachers. In addition, this could make teachers more aware of what is done, and how it is done, in the other groups, and think of aspects to improve in their own.","Luis has been an excellent teacher. Congratulations.","It is not fair that people can copy each other... in the case of transcription that we have all done the same experiment I have been aware that other groups copied images that I had designed in their notebooks, copied the protocol, the materials, the discussion, the future experiments... And it is true that it can be positive in some aspects: learning more about what other groups do, which gives you new ideas, helps you to improve... but I consider that, all in all, the negative aspects outweigh the positive ones, since seeing that you are being copied and nobody is going to notice (because you don't know who wrote it first) doesn't seem very fair to me.

It is not adequate that we have to eliminate people we don't want to be with, it seems to me to bring out the worst in people, to look for their defects. It would be better to choose those with whom we think we could work better, for example, if in the metabolism group there are 10 people, 9 without you, you have to put at least 6 with whom you could work. But not to put with whom not directly.  There should be one fellow per trio, specialized in the case of that group, to be able to help fully. Because sometimes the fellows didn't have much idea how we had to proceed.  I hope that the great participation and commitment of the teachers is taken into account, because they have been an excellent support. Except for some, who came very occasionally.  There were few flow booths and microoscopes.  The protocols are confusing, since they are not identical to the ones we performed, which gave rise to confusion.  I am not very clear about the format of the final exam, but for example, there are experimental procedures (processes such as qPCR, etc.) that, not having done them during this month of practice, I am lame, and I think that can influence the interpretation of experiments in the exam.

"162",2019,"One of the best aspects is that the practicals were done after the theoretical classes were finished and therefore we could focus on that exclusively. Also, they were a more different dynamic with more freedom in the lab which made us think more about the procedure we were doing, rather than just following a simple script.  ","the demand of all the groups was not the same, and I consider that the daily hours are not enough to be able to carry out all the experiments. the laboratory was very messy, sometimes it was difficult to find the reagents and if several groups needed to use the same material, this was sometimes very limited and made us lose time.  another aspect that seems unfair to me is not being able to choose partners, not in the sense of working with new people, but because at the end 1/3 of the notebook grade depends on what other partners who have done another experiment have written. in other words, since each member of the group is doing different experiments, we depend on each person to do their part of the notebook. in addition, a person can have done absolutely nothing and be given 70% of the grade.  ","I think that each group should share their ideas to analyze the protocols to follow and avoid making mistakes that would not have happened if they had known about them.  ","OneNote works well for working in groups when people in the group are not writing about the same section, as the synchronization time is very slow. also, it does not seem fair to me to be able to see the notebook of other groups when these groups are doing the same experiment, as they can copy from what is written by other groups. for example, you can copy the results or just the procedure through which the results were acquired without spending time thinking.

"327",2022,"The independence in developing the hypotheses and carrying out the experimental design increases the interest in the internship and gives the opportunity to work with people you would not otherwise have met","Too many people wanted to use the same machine (develop WB) and that made it all a bit chaotic.The session of discussing hypotheses between branches didn't do much good because each group had been given different guidelines to develop them.OneNote sometimes doesn't work very well.","","It does not handle excels input well (necessary for part of the calculations in many experiments) and always creates version conflictsThings sometimes took a long time to load between computers.","It helped us to get a little bit of a sense of where we were going, as none of us knew quite how to approach it.","There was some misunderstanding between what we wanted to do and the proposed hypothesis modifications."
"328",2022,"The teachers and the group of assistants, as well as the work format we followed in the fly group.","The group feedback class was poorly planned, since instead of being a class in which we get help to design our experiments and receive feedback on possible alternatives for our studies, it ended up being a discussion on the lexicon and grammar of our hypotheses, without much help to the studies themselves. On the other hand, the material was perhaps in some cases limiting in order to obtain better results.","","","",""

"330",2022,"The independence we are given","Too many hours dedicated to planning a protocol.  In addition, we were not told what we could do before starting to plan the shi`'oteisis, so many of the things we had thought of were not feasible and we had to start from scratch many times.","","","",""

"333",2022,"The ability to think for oneself and reasoning are developed. Juan and Modesto are great teachers and it has been a pleasure to work with them.","The feedback session seems more like a semantics class than anything else. It should focus more on learning about the other experiments than on formulating the hypothesis or general question.The reagents are bad and often out of date. As much as possible they should be renewed. For example the antibodies were not very good.","","","",""
