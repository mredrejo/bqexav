ELN;I knew OneNote before the course.;2019-2020
ELN;I find OneNote a useful app for the elaboration of the course Notebook.;2019-2020
ELN;I think we had enough previous information about the use of OneNote for the course laboratory notebook.;2019-2020
ELN;I would prefer other applications like Evernote, Google Docs, or MS Word.;2019-2020
ELN;The structure of the Notebook in Sections, Pages, and Subpages was easy to understand and use.;2019-2020
ELN;I would recommend to use OneNote for the ELN next year.;2019-2020
ELN;It overall allowed us to save time through the whole course.;2019-2020
ELN;It helped us in the preparation of the final version to be presented.;2019-2020
ELN;It made it easier working in groups.;2019-2020
ELN;It could be useful for other practical courses.;2019-2020
ELN;Synchronization issues hindered our teamworking.;2019-2020

ELN;The structure of the template matches the evaluation rubric.;2019-2020
ELN;The structure of 4 independent notes helped to understand each step of the work in a research lab.;2019-2020
ELN;The word limit in some sections of the template is appropriate (1;2019-2020
ELN;We had to modify some sections of the template to suit our experimental work.;2019-2020
ELN;The template will facilitate an even evaluation.;2019-2020
ELN;The use of an ELN with OneNote in this course will help us in future laboratory work (TFG, TFM, etc.).;2019-2020
